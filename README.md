# vibecoded_snowflake_crime_map
A simple app I wrote using Cursor and taking the "vibe coding" approach

You will need to create a database called NYC_CRIME_DATA with a schema called SOURCE_DATA.

Use the provided Parquet file to populate a table called NYC_YTD_COMPLAINTS_20250206.

This table will then be the source for the reduced data set in the app
